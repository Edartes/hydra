# Called to determine the set of supported input types. The plugin should add
# these to the $inputTypes hashref passed to the function.
#
# The value of it is another hashref, which defines some properties for handling
# that input type, like how to render the types properties or how to validate
# them.
#
# For example:
#
#   $inputTypes{'svn'} = {
#     name => 'Subversion checkout',
#     properties => {
#       uri => {label => "URI", required => 1},
#       revision => {label => "Revision"},
#     }
#   };
#
# The top-level of this consists of "name" (which is the user-visible name of
# the input type) and either "properties" or "singleton".
#
# The "properties" hashref is a collection of fields that can be set for a
# particular input and it maps from the name to another hashref specifying the
# information about that property:
#
#   label:      The label that is used for printing/editing
#   type:       The type of this property (for available types see below)
#   required:   Whether the user is required to enter a value for this property
#   help:       A help text that is displayed as a tool tip
#   validate:   A function that is used to validate the input (details below)
#   properties: Specifies nested properties (more about this below)
#
# All of these attributes are supported by "singleton" as well, because instead
# of a list of properties the "singleton" attribute designates only one possible
# input.
#
# Available property types:
#
#   bool:    Boolean
#   int:     Integer
#   attrset: A map between keys and values
#   secret:  A String that isn't publicly exposed
#   string:  String
#
# If no property type is specified, the default is "string".
#
# The "validate" property attribute is a function which gets passed the
# following arguments in this order:
#
#   controller: The current Controller object
#   name:       The name of the jobset input
#   value:      The value of the property
#
# The "controller" argument is very useful to trigger errors, like for example:
#
#   myproperty => {
#     label    => "An example property",
#     validate => sub {
#       my ($c, $name, $value) = @_;
#       error($c, 'You have entered an evil value!') if $value eq "evil";
#     }
#   }
#
# In this case if "evil" is entered as the properties value, an error would be
# returned and displayed to the user.
#
# If a property type declaration contains an attribute called "properties", the
# property itself becomes the top-level and can contain another set of
# properties as children.
#
# Instead of a plain value you get back a hashref which contains two keys:
#
#   value: The top-level value of the property type
#   children: All the child properties
#
# The structure of the "children" hashref is exactly the same as the one
# described above.
